Desgin:
	
	# Engine 
	----------------------
		Engine is the main controller in the crawler.
		
		It has a downloader object and a parser object, also two safe queues each for the download and parse tasks, 
		a status object holding the global status variables for the crawler and a mysql manager.
		
		Once the Engine starts up:
		
			it first loads seeds from the Google API into the download queue;
			it starts two threads each keep checking the download queue and parse queue, 
			once a html task is found in the queues, it is then assigned to the downloader or the parser; 
			The downloader will return html tasks to be parse and push them into the parse queue, 
			and the parser will return the html tasks to be download and push them into the download queue;
		
		
		
		
	



Special features beyond basic requirement:
	# user could decide the num of threads of downloader and parser
	# webpage interface and mysql for the crawler
	# good visualization of runtime status of the crawler
